My personal day-to-day reminder

## What I use

### Images and repo

* `docker push` (ex: docker push xaviersamuelhuppe/catnip) push an image to a repo
* `docker pull` Fetch an Image from a repo.
* `docker images` See all images on my computer.
* `docker rmi [IMAGE_ID]` Delete an image.
* `docker build [location of directory containing Dockerfile]` Create an image from a Dockerfile.
* `docker login` login...
### Containers

* `docker run` Run an image in a container.  
  * `-it` Attach us to an interactive tty in the container.
  * `-d` Detach terminal, make standalone process.
  * `-P` Publish all exposed ports to random ports.
  * `--name [something]` Give a name to the container.
  * `-p 8888:80` Attach port 80 of container to port 8888 of host.
* `docker port [container_name]` see published ports of exposed ports in container.
* `docker stop [CONTAINER_ID]` 

* `docker ps` See running containers.
  * `-a` See every containers (and remnants of old ones).
* `docker rm [CONTAINER_ID]` delete a container(s).
  * `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q -f status=exited)` Clever delete old containers.



## Everything

### Starting and Stopping

* [`docker start`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/start) starts a container so it is running.
* [`docker stop`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stop) stops a running container.
* [`docker restart`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/restart) stops and starts a container.
* [`docker pause`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/pause/) pauses a running container, "freezing" it in place.
* [`docker unpause`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/unpause/) will unpause a running container.
* [`docker wait`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/wait) blocks until running container stops.
* [`docker kill`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/kill) sends a SIGKILL to a running container.
* [`docker attach`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/attach) will connect to a running container.


### Lifecycle

* [`docker create`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/create) creates a container but does not start it.
* [`docker rename`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rename/) allows the container to be renamed.
* [`docker run`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run) creates and starts a container in one operation.
* [`docker rm`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rm) deletes a container.
* [`docker update`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/update/) updates a container's resource limits.

### Info

* [`docker ps`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps) shows running containers.
* [`docker logs`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs) gets logs from container.  (You can use a custom log driver, but logs is only available for `json-file` and `journald` in 1.10).
* [`docker inspect`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/inspect) looks at all the info on a container (including IP address).
* [`docker events`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/events) gets events from container.
* [`docker port`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/port) shows public facing port of container.
* [`docker top`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/top) shows running processes in container.
* [`docker stats`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/stats) shows containers' resource usage statistics.
* [`docker diff`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/diff) shows changed files in the container's FS.

### Lifecycle

* [`docker images`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/images) shows all images.
* [`docker import`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/import) creates an image from a tarball.
* [`docker build`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build) creates image from Dockerfile.
* [`docker commit`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit) creates image from a container, pausing it temporarily if it is running.
* [`docker rmi`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/rmi) removes an image.
* [`docker load`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/load) loads an image from a tar archive as STDIN, including images and tags (as of 0.7).
* [`docker save`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/save) saves an image to a tar archive stream to STDOUT with all parent layers, tags & versions (as of 0.7).

## Registry & Repository

* [`docker login`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login) to login to a registry.
* [`docker logout`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logout) to logout from a registry.
* [`docker search`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/search) searches registry for image.
